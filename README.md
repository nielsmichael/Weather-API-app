# Weather API App

This is a fun little Map-Weather project I am working on to familiarize myself with web APIs and using API calls to manipulate on screen data, 

as well as getting these APIs to talk to each other as the user interacts with the application.

## APIs Used

There are 2 APIs used:

1) Mapbox
2) OpeanWeatherMap
